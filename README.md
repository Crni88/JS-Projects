# Portfolio 

This repository is a collection of HTML/CSS and JS projects that I created and serves as my portfolio. 
Bellow is the explanation for each project and what functionalities I used while making them.

<b>#Form Validator</b> 

This is the first project I made. The simple form made in HTML, and styled with CSS. 
Regarding JS, the form has an event listener that checks if all the conditions are met. 
All the input fields are required, password and username need to be a certain length of characters. E-mail is checked using <b>Regex</b>.
 
<b>#Money Converter</b>

Pretty self-explanatory an aplication that converts one curreny to another. 
This aplication is made with exchangerate-api.com. 

<b>#Movie seat booking</b>

Ticket reservation application. The user has multiple movie options to chose from, as well as which seats he wants to take. 
The price and number of seats are updated dynamically. User choice is saved in local storage and will be saved if the tab is refreshed. 

<b>#Video player</b>

A custom video player, implementing .play( ) and .pause() functions. In addition to that custom progress tracker is added.

<b>#Hangman game</b>
A game of Hangman made in JS. I used SVG elements (line, circle) to draw the figure. Words are fetched from the random word generator api. Displays the message if you won/lost.

<b>#Meal Finder</b> <br/>
A program that finds meals based upon what you search. I used TheMealsDB API to fetch and load meals. When you find your meal, it displays the process of cooking and ingredients.
